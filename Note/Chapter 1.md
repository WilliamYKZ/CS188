# Chapter 1

## Intro

1. The field of **artifical intelligence**, goes further still: it attempts not just to undetstand but also to build intelligent entities. 



## What is AI

1. There are four approach in AI
   1. Thinking Humanly
   2. Thinking Rationally: A system is rational if it does the "right thing", given what it knowns.
   3. Acting Humanly
   4. Acting Rationally



2. Acting Humanly: **The turing Test Approach**.: A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. The computer would need to possess the following capabilities:

   - Natural Language Processing: to enable it to communicate successfully in English.
   - Knowledge representation: to store what it knows or hears.
   - Automated reasoning: to use the stored infomation to answer questions and to draw new conclusions:
   - Machine Learning: to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.

   But it avoided direct physical interaction between the interrogator and the computer, because physical simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence. But if a computer wants to pass total Turing test, they need:

   - Computer vision: to perceive objects, and
   - Robotics: to manipulate objects and move about.



3. Thinking Humanly: **The Cognitive Modeling Approach**:. First we need to know how human think. There are three ways to think of this.
   - Through introspection: trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by. 
   - Through psychological experiments: oberving a person in action.
   - Through brain imaging: Oberving the brain in action.



4. Thingking Rationally: The "Law of Thought" Approach: To let computer be more logic, that they know they are doing right thing. but there are two main obstacles. 
   - it is not east to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms requited by logical notation, particularly when the knowledge is less than 100% certain.
   - there is a big difference between solving a problem "in principle" and solving it in practive. (Even problems with just a few hundred facts can exhaust the computational resources of any computer unless it has some guidance as to which reasoning steps to try first.)



5. Acting Rationally: The Rational Agent Approach.: A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome, or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.

## Ths History of AI

### The gestation of AI (1943-1955)

1. The work done by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. They use three sources.

   - Knowledge of the basic physiology and function of neurons in the brain.
   - A formal analysis of propositional logic due to Russell and Whitehead.
   - Turing's theory of computation. 

   And they suggested that suitable defined networks could learn.

2. Donald Hebb(1949) demonstrated a simple updating rule for modifying the connection strengths between neurons. It is called **Hebbian Learning**.

3. Two undergraduate students at Harvard, Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds, butile the first neural netwoek computer in 1950. 

4. Child Programme: Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulated the child's.



### The birth of AI (1956)

We made AI as a separate field because.

- AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties such as creativity, self-improvement, and language use. 
- Methodology: Ai is the only one of these fields that is clearly a branch of computer science, and AI is the only firld to attempt to build machines that will function autonomously in complex, changing environments.



### Early enthusiasm, Great Expectation (1952-1969)
